CodeSchool Mongo Level 3

Create a gaming database and collections

It’s recommended to create this database but is not needed. 
For this item assume the database will have the monster collection. 
Assume a document will have the following data schema:

{
	"name": "Bat",
	"Level": 4,
	"health": 25,
	"type": "Flying",
	"attacks": ["scratch", "bite"],
	"stats": {
		"attack": 5,
		"defense": 2
	}
	"style": "cool"
}

In a file called mongo.js create the following commands. 
To help with syntax have your file look like this:

var mongo = function(db) {

};

Requirements:

1. Write the command that will find all monsters with an attack lower than 10

2. Write the command that will find all monsters with a level above 5 but below 15 inclusive

3. Write the command to find monsters that do not have the “bite” attack.

4. Write the command to find monsters with levels less than 
   6 but only return the name, level and health attributes

5. Write the command to find all monsters who attack is between 
   10 and 20 but do not include the monsters health or style

6. Write the command to find out how many monsters are in the collection.

7. Write the command to sort the collection by the monsters level 
   with the highest level at the top and the lowest at the bottom

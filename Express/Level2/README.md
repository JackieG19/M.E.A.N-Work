## Creating an express app

A /cities route in my app.js file with at least 4 cities.

An index route that refers to the following file:

 1. Making a folder called public

 2. An html file in public folder:
     - Includes an H1 header and a form with an empty selection element
     
 3. A js file that will make an ajax request to /cities and display each city inside the selection element.

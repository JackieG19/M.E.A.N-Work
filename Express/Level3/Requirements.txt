( Continue using the app from level 2. )

1. Create an express app.

2. A /cities route that will display all cities. (minimum of 5 cities)
    a. The /cities route should accept a limit query that will send back:
    b. The number of cities requested
    c. All cities if 0 is provided or if limit query is omitted
    d. return a status error if the limit is higher than the number of cities available in the list

3. Add a dynamic route to /cities. This should respond with the state that the city resides in.

4. Dynamic route should return Not Found status code if the requested city is not available.

5. Make sure to also normalize the data sent in the /cities route. 
   The city sent should be sendable in any case and still find the state itâ€™s in. 
   ie Providence and providence should both return Rhode Island.

6. Your normalizing of the data should use a middleware function.

7. The /cities route should still display 

8. The other routes only need be accessed by curl currently
